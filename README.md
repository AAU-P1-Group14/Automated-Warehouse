=======
This tool is designed to simulate different algorithms and benchmark them on either a predefined or user-created dynamic layout.

The following shows the program's user interface, which lists 7 options:

#### (1) - Start Simulation: Runs the algorithms after configuring the warehouse environment.

#### (2) - Custom Target: 
Allows the user to choose a custom pickup shelf.

#### (3) - Random Target: 
Selects a random target.

#### (4) - Predefined Layout: 
Sets the layout to the default layout. This is the layout used when the program starts and is useful if you previously chose a custom layout but want to revert to the default.

#### (5) - Dynamic Layout: 
Allows the user to create a custom layout (within certain limits) with 5 different customization parameters.

#### (6) - Select Benches: 
Lets the user choose how many benchmarks (benches) the algorithms should run before returning results.

#### (0) - Exit: 
Exits the program.

When the program runs, the user can customize all of the above parameters to their preference. After configuration, the simulation can be started by selecting option 1.
